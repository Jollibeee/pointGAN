Options/Arguments:
   -h          Display this help text

   -D key=val  Define a constant, which can referenced as "$key" in the scene

   -o fname    Write the output image to the file denoted by "fname"

   -a p1;p2;.. Add one or more entries to the resource search path

   -p count    Override the detected number of processors. Useful for reducing
               the load or creating scheduling-only nodes in conjunction with
               the -c and -s parameters, e.g. -p 0 -c host1;host2;host3,...

   -q          Quiet mode - do not print any log messages to stdout

   -c hosts    Network rendering: connect to mtssrv instances over a network.
               Requires a semicolon-separated list of host names of the form
                       host.domain[:port] for a direct connection
                 or
                       user@host.domain[:path] for a SSH connection (where
                       "path" denotes the place where Mitsuba is checked
                       out -- by default, "~/mitsuba" is used)

   -s file     Connect to additional Mitsuba servers specified in a file
               with one name per line (same format as in -c)

   -j count    Simultaneously schedule several scenes. Can sometimes accelerate
               rendering when large amounts of processing power are available
               (e.g. when running Mitsuba on a cluster. Default: 1)

   -n name     Assign a node name to this instance (Default: host name)

   -x          Skip rendering of files where output already exists

   -r sec      Write (partial) output images every 'sec' seconds

   -b res      Specify the block resolution used to split images into parallel
               workloads (default: 32). Only applies to some integrators.

   -v          Be more verbose (can be specified twice)

   -L level    Explicitly specify the log level (trace/debug/info/warn/error)

   -w          Treat warnings as errors

   -z          Disable progress bars
